## Hermes

Hermes is a speed reading app with a look at practical usage.

Pair programmed at [RC](https://recurse.com) SP1 2017 by Carl J. Factora & Alberto Zaccagni

### The idea

Being able to speed read technical books.

The challenge is that sometimes while reading you encounter code snippets, or chemical
formulas, or math expressions, it would be great if those could appear on screen, nicely
formatted, so you don't exit your speed reading flow.

We will provide a GIF soon!
